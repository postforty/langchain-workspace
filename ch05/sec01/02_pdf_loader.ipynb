The Private \\nLLM system provides sophisticated and accurate answers based on clinical data and shows its potential \\nfor use in various applications such as decision support, clinical expert activity assistance, new content \\ngeneration, and problem solving. The study consists of the following four main steps. First, data \\nspecific to clinical trials of medical devices are collected, preprocessed, and organized into a learnable \\nformat. Second, based on open-source LLM models such as LaMA, PEFT (LoRA) and RAG techniques \\nare applied to build a customized private LLM Q&A system for a specific clinical domain. Third, it \\nrealizes expert-level Q&A function by utilizing the established system and solves complex questions and \\nproblems that arise during clinical trial operation. Finally, by evaluating the performance of the system, \\nwe propose a direction to increase the efficiency and reliability of clinical trial operation and medical \\ndevice development. As a result of the study, the Private LLM system has outperformed the existing \\nmethodology in supporting task automation and precise decision making. In particular, the ability to \\nprovide accurate answers to questions from domain experts and to generate new clinical criteria and \\ninsights shows the potential to become an innovative tool in clinical trial operation of medical devices. \\nThis confirmed the practical applicability of Private LLM in precision medical care, automation of \\nclinical trial management, and a Q&A system based on domain knowledge. \\n▸Key words: Large Language Models(LLMs), Generative Al, Clinical Trials, Medical Devices, Data Analysis\\n∙First Author: Hyon-Chel Jung, Corresponding Author: Sung-Bin Park\\n  *Hyon-Chel Jung (bravojhc@yonsei.ac.kr), Dept. of Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Medicine, \\nYonsei University Wonju College of Medicine\\n  **Kun-Soo Shin (tlsrjstn788@naver.com), Dept. of Yonsei University Future Medical Industry Cooperation Group\\n  ***Ho-Dong Kim (hodong.kim@solbit.kr), Corporate Research Institute, Solbit Co., Ltd.\\n  ****Sung-Bin Park (sung.b.park@gmail.com), Dept. of Precision Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine\\n∙Received: 2024. 11. 01, Revised: 2024. 12. 02, Accepted: 2024. 12. 18.\\nCopyright ⓒ 2024 The Korea Society of Computer and Information                                               \\n      http://www.ksci.re.kr pISSN:1598-849X | eISSN:2383-9945')"
